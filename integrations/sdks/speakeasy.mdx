## Speakeasy SDK Repository Changes

In your Speakeasy SDK repos add the following addition to the targets section of your `.speakeasy/workflow.yaml` file to ensure code samples automatically get produced alongside your SDK generations.

```yaml .speakeasy/workflow.yaml
targets:
    my-target:
        target: typescript
        source: my-source
        codeSamples:
          output: codeSamples.yaml
```

Code samples will not be generated in the form of an [overlay file](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/openapi/overlays) that will be used in the Mintlify docs repository.

## Mintlify Docs Repository Changes

The workflow files produced will automatically bundle together your source OpenAPI spec and Speakeasy code samples into a single output file - openapi.yaml. Mintlify will use this output file when constructing your API reference. 

### Interactive CLI Setup

Run the following commands to setup your `.speakeasy/workflow.yaml` and `.github/workflows/sdk_generation.yaml` files through Speakeasy's interactive CLI.

```bash
speakeasy configure sources
speakeasy configure github
```

Set up your source spec. This is the OpenAPI spec that you want to generate code samples for. Often it is the same specification used to power your Mintlify docs.

We'll now add the overlay created by Speakeasy to inject code snippets into your spec.

![](/images/speakeasy-2.webp)

Finally provide name and path for your output openapi spec. This will the final spec used by Mintlify.

![](/images/speakeasy-3.webp)

Lastly, make sure you add your `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` as a repository secret to your Minlify repo under Settings > Secrets & Variables > Actions. This can be found in your Speakeasy dashboard API Keys tab.

## Manual Setup

Alternatively your can manually setup the following files in your Mintlify docs repo.


```yaml .speakeasy/workflow.yaml
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
sources:
    docs-source:
        inputs:
            - location: {{your_api_spec}} # local or remote references supported
        overlays:
            - location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{your_sdk_repo_1}}/codeSamples.yaml
            - location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{your_sdk_repo_2}}/codeSamples.yaml
            - location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{your_sdk_repo_3}}/codeSamples.yaml
        output: openapi.yaml
targets: {}
```

```yaml .speakeasy/workflows/sdk_generation.yaml
name: Generate
permissions:
  checks: write
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write
"on":
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force:
        description: Force generation of SDKs
        type: boolean
        default: false
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * *
jobs:
  generate:
    uses: speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action/.github/workflows/workflow-executor.yaml@v15
    with:
      force: ${{ github.event.inputs.force }}
      mode: pr
      speakeasy_version: latest
    secrets:
      github_access_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      speakeasy_api_key: ${{ secrets.SPEAKEASY_API_KEY }}
```

Lastly, make sure you add your` SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` as a repository secret to your Minlify repo under *Settings > Secrets & Variables > Actions. This can be found in your Speakeasy dashboard API Keys tab.
