OpenAPI 3 has some advanced features for describing complex APIs. Here's how you can use them with Mintlify.

## `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`

For complex datatypes, OpenAPI provides the `oneOf`, `anyOf`, and `allOf` keywords, allowing you to combine schemas in certain ways. You can read more about these keywords in the [Swagger documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/oneof-anyof-allof-not/), but essentially:

- `oneOf` functions like an "exclusive-or" operator
- `anyOf` functions like an "or" operator
- `allOf` functions like an "and" operator

<Warning>Mintlify treats the `oneOf` and `anyOf` keywords the same. We have found that, when people use `oneOf`, they often *mean* `anyOf` - and there is often no meaningful difference to the user.</Warning>

Mintlify performs some preprocessing on your OpenAPI document to display these complex combinations in a readable way. For example, when you combine two object schemas with `allOf`, Mintlify combines the properties of both into a single object. When you combine two schemas with `anyOf` or `oneOf`, Mintlify displays the options in a tabbed container. To give your options helpful names, make sure to give each subschema a unique `title` field.

<Info>Mintlify currently does not support the `not` keyword.</Info>

## `x-codeSamples`

If your users interact with your API using an SDK rather than directly through a network request, you can add code samples to your OpenAPI document, and Mintlify will display them in your OpenAPI pages. You can define your code samples using the `x-codeSamples` extension described in [Redocly's documentation](https://redocly.com/docs/api-reference-docs/specification-extensions/x-code-samples/). This property can be added within any request method, and has the following schema:

<ParamField body="lang" type="string" required>
  The language of the code sample.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="label" type="string">
  The label for the sample. This is useful when providing multiple examples for a single endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source" type="string" required>
  The source code of the sample.
</ParamField>

Here's an example of some code samples for a plant tracking app, which has both a Bash CLI tool and a JavaScript SDK.

```yaml
paths:
  /plants:
    get:
      ...
      x-codeSamples:
        - lang: bash
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            planter list -u
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ unwatered: true });
        - lang: bash
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            planter list -p
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ potted: true });
```
